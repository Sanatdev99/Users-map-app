## What Affects Car Shipping Costs?

Understanding the factors that influence auto transport pricing helps you make informed decisions and find the best value.

## Key Cost Factors

### 1. Distance
The farther your vehicle needs to travel, the higher the cost. However, per-mile costs decrease for longer distances.

**Example Pricing:**
- Under 500 miles: $1.00 - $1.50 per mile
- 500-1,500 miles: $0.75 - $1.00 per mile
- Over 1,500 miles: $0.50 - $0.75 per mile

### 2. Vehicle Size and Weight
Larger, heavier vehicles cost more to transport.

**Vehicle Categories:**
- Sedans: Lowest cost
- SUVs: Moderate cost
- Trucks: Higher cost
- Large vehicles: Highest cost

### 3. Transport Type

**Open Transport:** $300 - $1,200
- Most economical option
- Standard protection

**Enclosed Transport:** $800 - $1,700
- Premium protection
- Weather-sealed

### 4. Season and Timing
Summer months (May-September) have higher demand and prices.

**Peak Season:** Higher rates
**Off-Season:** Better deals

### 5. Vehicle Condition
Inoperable vehicles require special equipment and cost more.

**Operable:** Standard rates
**Inoperable:** Additional $150-$300

## How to Save Money

### 1. Book in Advance
Early booking often gets better rates.

### 2. Be Flexible with Dates
Flexible pickup/delivery dates can reduce costs.

### 3. Choose Open Transport
If your vehicle doesn't require enclosed transport, save 40-50%.

### 4. Ship Multiple Vehicles
Discount available for multiple vehicle shipments.

### 5. Terminal-to-Terminal
Dropping off and picking up at terminals is cheaper than door-to-door.
